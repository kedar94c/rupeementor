            <h2>Why Budgeting and Planning Are Your Financial Superpowers</h2>
            <p>Budgeting is your money’s GPS, while financial planning is the destination. Together, they help Indian Millennials (born 1981–1996) and Gen Z (born 1997–2012) tackle challenges like rising living costs (up 7% annually in metro cities) and loans averaging ₹12,00,000 for Millennials and ₹6,00,000 for Gen Z. A 2025 survey shows 48% of Gen Z and 46% of Millennials feel financially insecure, often living paycheck to paycheck. Planning gives you control, whether you’re saving for a bike or investing for a flat. <a href="https://yourfinancesite.com/how-to-prioritize-financial-goals">Learn to prioritize your goals</a>.</p>
