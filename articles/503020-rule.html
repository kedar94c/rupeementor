    <p>Setting financial goals is the foundation of any successful financial plan, yet most studies show fewer than 10% of people achieve their ambitious goals. The key difference between dreamers and achievers lies in how they structure and track objectives using the SMART framework.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Understanding SMART Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Define exact targets. Instead of “save money,” say “save ₹5 lakh for a house down payment.”</li>
      <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Attach metrics—“save ₹13,900 each month” for three years.</li>
      <li><strong>Achievable:</strong> Ensure the goal stretches you without breaking your budget.</li>
      <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Align each goal with your personal values and family needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Set a firm deadline, such as “within three years.”</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="tip"><strong>Did you know?</strong> Writing down SMART goals makes you 42% more likely to achieve them.</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Three-Tier Goal Framework</h2>
    <p>Organize your aspirations into three time horizons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Short-term (1–3 years):</strong> Emergency fund, annual vacation, gadget upgrades.</li>
      <li><strong>Medium-term (3–10 years):</strong> Car purchase, home down payment, children’s school.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term (10+ years):</strong> Retirement corpus, children’s marriage, legacy wealth.</li>
    </ul>

      <canvas id="goalsChart"></canvas>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Prioritizing and Accounting for Inflation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>List & Rank:</strong> Inventory all goals, then rank by urgency—e.g., young families often prioritize an emergency fund and term insurance over luxury spending.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation Adjustment:</strong> India’s CPI inflation was 2.82% in May 2025. At 6–8% annual inflation, a ₹10 lakh education fund today becomes ~₹21.6 lakh in ten years.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional Motivation:</strong> Attach compelling reasons—“maintain lifestyle without burdening my children”—to fuel consistency.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">Clarity + Emotion + Action = Achievable Goals</blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Breaking Down Big Dreams Into Monthly Steps</h2>
    <p>Divide large targets into monthly SIPs. To reach ₹15 lakh in 10 years at 10% returns, you'd need roughly ₹7,505/month.</p>
    <div class="tip"><strong>Use Online SIP Calculators:</strong> They translate future needs into exact monthly contributions.</div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Quarterly Review & Adaptation</h2>
    <p>Conduct goal reviews every three months to adjust contributions, timelines, or priorities—keeping your plan both flexible and on track.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SMART goals boost success by adding clarity and structure.</li>
      <li>Segment goals into short, medium, and long horizons for focus.</li>
      <li>Factor in current inflation (∼2.82% YoY) and review quarterly.</li>
    </ul>
